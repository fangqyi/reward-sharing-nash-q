train(): double loop
while not converge:
    - select pq
    - sample and train DGN Q(a|obs, pq) with the selected pq for N batches
    - evaluate the trained DGN
    - update Q(pq) with the evaluated result

problems:
discrete pq: each time any agent allow to commit to only 1 agent in its pq selection
    - coordination game
    - 3hrs training time and only 1 agent is able to get non-0 rewards after redistribution...

inefficient sampling for pq
